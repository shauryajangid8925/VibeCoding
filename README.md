# College Demo Website (React + Tailwind)

This repository contains a **dummy college web page** created for academic submission. It is a front‑end only project built with **Create React App** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
> Note: I’ve added **clear, English comments** across the source files to make the code easy to review. **No functional code was changed.**

## ✨ Highlights
- React (Create React App)
- Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- Responsive layout and reusable components
- Build output included in `/build` for quick hosting

## 📁 Project Structure (high‑level)
```
/public          # Static assets + index.html
/src             # React source code (components, styles)
  /components    # All UI components
  App.js         # Root component composition
  index.js       # React entry point
tailwind.config.js
postcss.config.js
package.json
```
Comments were added mainly in: `src/**/*.js`, `src/**/*.css`, and `public/index.html`.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local)
1. **Install Node.js** (LTS recommended).  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## 🏗️ Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
The production build is generated in `/build`. You can deploy that folder to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.). A `_redirects` file is present for SPA routing support.

## 🧰 Scripts (from package.json)
- `npm start` – Start dev server
- `npm run build` – Production build
- `npm test` – Run tests (if any)
- `npm run eject` – CRA eject (not recommended for this assignment)

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- **React** (Create React App / `react-scripts`)
- **Tailwind CSS** (configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`)

## 📌 Notes for Reviewers / Faculty
- This is a **dummy project** for demonstration only. No backend or database.
- All files include explanatory comments; functionality remains unchanged.
- Images and assets are used purely for UI/UX demonstration.
